The Rapid Logger is designed to be a personal task management system that helps you capture and organize your tasks/events/thoughts quickly and easily. The brain often doesn't work in an orderly fashion so organizing your task manager that way doesn't always work. Our rapid logger allows you to quickly type in your events/tasks/notes using hotkeys. Once you've typed out everything you wanted to add to your log, you hit "Add to Logs" and our rapid logger sorts the information for you. You also have the ability to update or delete items as you see fit.

I implemented MVC architecture which encrypts new usersâ€™ passwords or authenticates returning users.

## Future Plan
In the future, we hope to continue improving the site. We would like our update method to be a little more streamlined and also allow the user to add dates to events/tasks. We would also like the user to be able to customize their own hotkeys if they prefer to use their own rather than the ones we set up.
